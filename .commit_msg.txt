feat: smart ETA learning, chart timeframes, graph hover, auth token reuse

Graph (Tasks 1 & 2):
- Add timeframe buttons [15m / 30m / 1h / All] to chart card header
- Client-side history filtering; gracefully falls back to full history when
  the selected window is longer than actual queue time
- Drop server-side slice(-60) limit; full 720-point history now sent to client
  so timeframe filtering works correctly
- Add canvas hover tooltip showing exact queue position and timestamp;
  correct retina (2x) coordinate scaling
- Store rendered data point coordinates for efficient nearest-point lookup

Smart ETA learning (Task 3):
- New src/eta-learner.js module stores completed session data locally in
  data/eta-learn.json (up to 200 sessions, never leaves the machine)
- Tracks day-of-week and hour-of-day context per session
- Three-source blended estimate:
    1. Exponential decay base model (always contributes)
    2. Historical rate from similar time/day sessions (weighted by recency)
    3. Live rate observed from the current session (grows in weight as more
       samples are collected)
- Weights adapt: more historical data = more confident learned estimate
- ETALearner accepts optional dataPath for clean unit testing
- 8 new tests; all 34 tests pass

Auth token reuse (Task 4):
- _checkCachedAuth() scans profilesFolder before each queue start
- Logs "Found cached auth ... attempting token reuse" vs
  "No cached tokens found - device-code sign-in required"
- Actual reuse already worked via node-minecraft-protocol's MSAL cache;
  this adds clear user feedback

Codebase review fixes:
- server.js stateChange now sends full queueHistory (was still sliced to 60)
- proxy.js queueHistory cap raised from 120 to 720 (~12h at 1 update/min)
- ETALearner integrated into proxy.js: beginSession, recordSample,
  estimateMinutes, recordCompletedSession all wired up correctly
